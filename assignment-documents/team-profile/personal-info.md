#### From Assignment 1

Originally born in Adelaide, I moved to Victoria in late 2003 where I met my now wife in high school. During my schooling I was recommended to pursue Engineering as a career path as my ideal job was Inventor. I started a degree in Engineering at university and after some time I realised that my expectations for what I was hoping to achieve weren't being met. I then pursued and completed a traineeship in Engineering (Technical) at my current place of employment. I have continued to work there over the past 9 years improving my knowledge and role base and during this time I have also been fortunate enough to be blessed with a daughter who just started school. I enjoy many aspects of life, but one of my more interesting past hobbies is that from a young age I enjoyed playing lawn bowl. I started playing lawn bowls when I was around the age of 11 and really enjoyed the competitiveness and social aspects to the game. Perhaps the largest highlight from playing lawn bowls was when I competed in a state school competition and ended up second in the state for my age.

As a consumer, IT has interested me from very young, particularly in the form of video games. During school I found myself soaking in all the IT subjects and completing projects very quickly. It was only a few years ago when I started managing more of the IT systems at work that I began to realise that I had a real passion to work in the IT industry. I didn't realise that it was more than just a hobby for me and have been considering completing a degree for some time. Due to health reasons I have been unable to start this journey until this year.

## Bruno Gusmao

From Sao Paulo, Brazil. My student number is s3851527. I first came to Australia in 2014 with my wife to study English. We both fell in love with this country and decided to make Australia our new home. Since then, I have studied Building Design (Architectural) through Holmesglen Institute in Melbourne and got a job as an Architectural Draftsperson back in 2016. In 2018 we have moved down to Hobart. Portuguese is my native language, but I also speak a bit of Spanish. I am currently trying to learn some French, but cannot find much time lately. My favourite hobbies are watching Football and playing Videogames. I have always had an interest in Technology but never got do any formal studies in this field. I believe that IT jobs will be in high demand in the future, as already happens, and I want to keep myself relevant to the job market.
