#### From Assignment 1

Originally born in Adelaide, I moved to Victoria in late 2003 where I met my now wife in high school. During my schooling I was recommended to pursue Engineering as a career path as my ideal job was Inventor. I started a degree in Engineering at university and after some time I realised that my expectations for what I was hoping to achieve weren't being met. I then pursued and completed a traineeship in Engineering (Technical) at my current place of employment. I have continued to work there over the past 9 years improving my knowledge and role base and during this time I have also been fortunate enough to be blessed with a daughter who just started school. I enjoy many aspects of life, but one of my more interesting past hobbies is that from a young age I enjoyed playing lawn bowl. I started playing lawn bowls when I was around the age of 11 and really enjoyed the competitiveness and social aspects to the game. Perhaps the largest highlight from playing lawn bowls was when I competed in a state school competition and ended up second in the state for my age.

As a consumer, IT has interested me from very young, particularly in the form of video games. During school I found myself soaking in all the IT subjects and completing projects very quickly. It was only a few years ago when I started managing more of the IT systems at work that I began to realise that I had a real passion to work in the IT industry. I didn't realise that it was more than just a hobby for me and have been considering completing a degree for some time. Due to health reasons I have been unable to start this journey until this year.

## Ellie Brice

My Name is Ellie Brice and my student number is S3851560.
I have lived in Adelaide all my life. I graduated high school at Annesley College and after graduation I struggled to decide which direction to take my career. I initially worked in sales, and then as a receptionist for a finance company, both of which I did not enjoy. I decided to become a technician for a large telecommunications company. I enjoy the challenge of investigating difficult faults, working with other people and working outside. Due to a decrease in workload and redundancies from the implementation of NBN, I have been considering a new career in IT, specifically in programming.  I am married to my wife Tamara and we have 3 cats. I spend my free time playing Dungeons and Dragons, playing board games with my friends and collecting Star Wars LEGO sets. I am member of the Events Management Team for the Adelaide Browncoats, a fan club of the TV show Firefly and film Serenity, where we plan movie screenings and fundraising events to raise money for charity. This year I participated in the Relay for Life and my team raised money for the Cancer Council. I enjoy fun-runs and obstacle courses, as I aim to improve my fitness and live a healthier lifestyle.
I have always been interested in IT, and I am the unofficial IT person that other people at work turn to for help. My interest in programming stems from using programs that are unsuitable for the purpose they have been crudely adapted for, and wanting to know how to fix or improve them. I think technology should be easy to use and intuitive to the way people think. I have a certificate III in Telecommunications, and experience with: Copper cable and Coaxial jointing, cabling and fault finding, Structures cabling (Cat5 and Cat6), Optical Fibre splicing, Windows upgrades and rollout of new PCâ€™s to staff and Networking and TCP/IP.

## Bruno Gusmao

From Sao Paulo, Brazil. My student number is s3851527. I first came to Australia in 2014 with my wife to study English. We both fell in love with this country and decided to make Australia our new home. Since then, I have studied Building Design (Architectural) through Holmesglen Institute in Melbourne and got a job as an Architectural Draftsperson back in 2016. In 2018 we have moved down to Hobart. Portuguese is my native language, but I also speak a bit of Spanish. I am currently trying to learn some French, but cannot find much time lately. My favourite hobbies are watching Football and playing Videogames. I have always had an interest in Technology but never got do any formal studies in this field. I believe that IT jobs will be in high demand in the future, as already happens, and I want to keep myself relevant to the job market.
